* extDrvDmaWrite
*
* DESCRIPTION:
*       Write a given buffer to the given address using the Dma.
*
* INPUTS:
*       address     - The destination address to write to.
*       buffer      - The buffer to be written.
*       length      - Length of buffer in words.
*       burstLimit  - Number of words to be written on each burst.
*
* OUTPUTS:
*       None.
*
* RETURNS:
*       GT_OK   - on success,
*       GT_FAIL - othersise.
*
* COMMENTS:
*       1.  The given buffer is allways 4 bytes aligned, any further allignment
*           requirements should be handled internally by this function.
*       2.  The given buffer may be allocated from an uncached memory space, and
*           it's to the function to handle the cache flushing.
*       3.  The Prestera Driver assumes that the implementation of the DMA is
*           blocking, otherwise the Driver functionality might be damaged.
