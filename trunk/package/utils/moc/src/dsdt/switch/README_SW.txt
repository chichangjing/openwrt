    * The Switch Driver Suite Source Code is OS independent, and fully supported by Marvell.
    * The Sample Codes are tested under vxworks and Linux, and is provided for reference only.


3) General Introduction
-----------------------

The Switch driver suite is standalone program, which is independent of both OS and Platform. 
As such, applications of MSAPIs need to register platform specific functions. 
This is done by calling qdLoadDriver function. This function returns a pointer (*dev), 
which contains the device and platform information. It will then be used for each MSAPI call. 

msApiInit.c file in Diag directory and Sample\Initialization directory demonstrate 
how you can register those functions.

msApiInit.c
    qdStart is the main function to initialize Switch Driver and does the 
    followings:
    a) register the platform specific functions. 
       1.1 and 1.2 below are required.
       1.3 to 1.4 is for F2R(Remote management), it is selected 
          by flag GT_RMGMT_ACCESS in IncludemsApiDefs.h.
       1.5 to 1.8 is optional.
        1.1) readMii - BSP specific MII read function 
        1.2) writeMii - BSP specific MII write function 
        1.3) hwAccessMod - BSP supported function mode 
        1.4) hwAccess - BSP specific hardware access function 
        1.5) semCreate - OS specific semaphore create function.
        1.6) semDelete - OS specific semaphore delete function.
        1.7) semTake - OS specific semaphore take function.
        1.8) semGive - OS specific semaphore give function.

        Notes) The given example will use DB-88E6218 BSP as an example.

    b) Initialize BSP provided routine (if required).

    c) Calls qdLoadDriver routine.
        1.1) Input (GT_SYS_CONFIG) - CPU Port Number (Board Specific) and Port Mode 
        (either 1 for Forwarding mode or 0 for Hardware default mode)
        1.2) Output (GT_QD_DEV) - Contains all device (Switch) and platform specific info.
             It will be used for all API calls.

    d) Calls sysEnable (for future use.)

6) HOW TO - Build qdDrv.o for Linux
-----------------------------------

1. Extract the given ZIP file into $HOME/DSDT_3.x/switch directory(directory can be changed)
 `   in Linux system (verified with Fedore 8.x)
2. Edit setenv file in $HOME/DSDT_3.x/switch/tools
3. Modify the following variables according to your setup.
    declare -x DSDT_USER_BASE=$HOME/DSDT_3.x/switch
    declare -x DSDT_PROJ_NAME=qdDrv
    declare -x DSDT_USE_MAD=FALSE or TRUE

5. Change directory to $HOME/DSDT_3.x/switch/src
6. run "make"
7. qdDrv.o and qdDrv.map will be created in $HOME/DSDT_3.x/switch/Library.

7) HOW TO - Use Phy driver in qdDrv.o
-------------------------------------

 The Phy driver(DSDT/phy or MAD) supports Marvell Phy products. It includes the phys in switch chips. 
 From DSDT 3.0A, the Switch driver added functions to merge MAD driver 
 to get all Phy API functions. This is an option to uses QD over MAD APIs, <GT_USE_MAD>. There is no any difference from API point of view, if it uses <GT_USE_MAD>.
 So far, the most Phy regarded functions in switch driver do not need to use <GT_USE_MAD>. After 88E6352, there are some new features, which are supported by MAD only. It should use <GT_USE_MAD>.
 To use <GT_USE_MAD> is selectable. The selection is to define <GT_USE_MAD> in <msApiSelect.h>. 
 Through <GT_USE_MAD>, customer can run all Phy API in MAD to get Phy function in switch. The new Phy functions in the latest switch chip see related Phy datasheet. To call Phy API of MAD, the device argument(MAD_DEV) in API functions is <qddev->mad_dev>.

8) HOW TO - select features in msApiSelect.h  
---------------------------------------------

 Customer can ignore the selections. The default selections are <undef> for all.

 From DSDT_3.0D, DSDT adds file <msApiSelect.h> in DSDT*.*/Include.
 The file allows customer to select self features.
 Now selections are:
    GT_PORT_MAP_IN_DEV: To use port mapping functions in Dev configuration.
    GT_RMGMT_ACCESS: DSDT uses RMGMT to replace SMI.
    GT_USE_MAD: the phy APIs of switch use Mad driver(DSDT/phy).

 If customer wants to use the selection,
   1. Adds a Micro definition <CHECK_API_SELECT> in customers build environment.
     For example, in <makefile>, adds <CFLAGS += -DCHECK_API_SELECT>.
   2. In file <Include/msApiSelect>, set correct selections.
   3. Re-build DSDT/switch.
  

9) HOW TO - build driver  
-----------------------------------

 Change directory to $HOME/DSDT_3.x/
 <make switch>: to build switch driver image only.
 <make phy>: to build phy driver image only.
 <make>: to build switch and phy driver images, and switch driver does not use MAD APIs.
 <make DSDT_USE_MAD=TRUE>: to build switch and phy driver images, and switch driver uses MAD APIs.
