Subject: [PATCH] mtd: nand: sunxi: Add NAND_BBT_CREATE_EMPTY to bbt_options

The ftl format used by the Allwinner Android kernels, with which most
Allwinnner devices ship, overrides the factory bad block markers, and
fills the oob data with a pattern which causes a lot of false bad block
positives, so when we first create a bbt table, start with an empty one
to avoid marking a ton of blocks as bad from the start.
