Subject: [PATCH] x86/platform: Fix Geode LX timekeeping in the generic x86
 build

In 2007, commit 07190a08eef36 ("Mark TSC on GeodeLX reliable")
bypassed verification of the TSC on Geode LX. However, this code
(now in the check_system_tsc_reliable() function in
arch/x86/kernel/tsc.c) was only present if CONFIG_MGEODE_LX was
set.

OpenWRT has recently started building its generic Geode target
for Geode GX, not LX, to include support for additional
platforms. This broke the timekeeping on LX-based devices,
because the TSC wasn't marked as reliable:
https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/20531

By adding a runtime check on is_geode_lx(), we can also include
the fix if CONFIG_MGEODEGX1 or CONFIG_X86_GENERIC are set, thus
fixing the problem.
